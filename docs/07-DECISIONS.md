# 07 — Decision Log

**Last updated:** 18 Aug 2026 (rev 4) · Supersedes rev 3

Every architectural decision, dated, with reasoning. **Never edit an entry.** When a decision
changes, add a new one that supersedes it. The history is the point — it stops decisions being
re-argued and stops an AI tool from silently choosing differently.

## Closed

| # | Decision | Choice | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | Product thesis | One-turn billing that never silently gets a number wrong | Pilloo has better recognition and still needs 4 turns, and printed ₹300 for a ₹150 bill with no warning |
| **A2** | Primary metric | Turns-to-bill, target 1 | Accuracy alone is insufficient — Pilloo is accurate *and* slow |
| **A3** | Udhaar in MVP | **Out** | Doesn't test the differentiator. Schema stays ledger-ready. |
| **A4** | Shop profile | Unlimited bills, unlimited catalog, mobile + desktop | Owner decision |
| **C1** | Delivery | **Web + PWA first.** Android (Capacitor) only after web MVP is complete. iOS deferred. | Owner decision, rev 2. One surface at a time. |
| **C2** | Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite | Standard, best AI-tool support, Capacitor-compatible |
| **C4** | Database | Supabase / Postgres | Relational integrity for money |
| **C5** | Auth (MVP) | Google sign-in only | Phone OTP needs DLT/TRAI registration → needs a registered business entity |
| **D1** | Money | Integer paise everywhere | No floats, ever |
| **D4** | Catalog model | Shared versioned base + per-shop catalog; shop picks at onboarding; can pull base items in and edit price | Owner decision |
| **E1** | Sequencing | Fix eval + pricing grammar **before** any new feature work | Owner decision |
| **B1** | STT primary | Groq Whisper large-v3, behind a provider interface | Proven. **Not** turbo: 22.3% vs 15.7% WER. |
| **B4** | Parse layer | Deterministic grammar first, LLM fallback | Fixes latency, cost, reproducibility together |
| **B7** | Interaction model | Push-to-talk, batch. Never conversational. | Conversational design is exactly why Pilloo needs 4 turns |
| **B10** | Learning scope | Strictly per-shop | Current code defaults to `"global"` — silent multi-tenancy break |

## D5 — Offline AND online, staged 🟢

**Supersedes:** "online only" (rev 1). Owner decision.

Offline is not one feature. It's four levels with very different costs. MVP ships levels 1–2.

| Level | Capability | MVP? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Offline read** — catalog, history, settings cached and browsable | ✅ Yes |
| 2 | **Offline manual billing** — create, edit, finalise without network; sync on reconnect | ✅ Yes |
| 3 | **Offline voice** | ❌ No — requires on-device STT. See O1. |
| 4 | Multi-device concurrent editing with conflict resolution | ❌ No — one device per shop in MVP |

### Architecture: local-first, not an outbox bolt-on

The app always reads and writes **IndexedDB**. A background sync worker reconciles with Supabase.
**One write path**, so offline is the natural behaviour rather than a special case. A bolted-on
outbox creates two write paths, and that is where the bugs live.

**Why this is tractable here:** finalised bills are **immutable and append-only**. There is almost no
conflict surface. The only mutable data is the shop catalog and shop settings — both low-frequency,
both resolvable with last-write-wins plus a timestamp.

### The one hard problem: receipt numbering offline

A sequential per-shop receipt number cannot be assigned without the server.

**Solution: block allocation.** When online, the device reserves a block of receipt numbers (e.g.
50). Offline bills draw from the reserved block, so **the number shown to the customer never changes
after sync**. If the block is exhausted while offline, fall back to a device-prefixed number and
reconcile on sync.

---

## D6 — Customer name and mobile on the bill 🟢

**Owner decision:** name always present, mobile optional. Both stored on the bill so the future
udhaar feature has the data.

**⚠️ One modification, and it matters.**

A *mandatory* customer name directly violates non-negotiable #2 — *never ask a question mid-bill* —
and reproduces the exact friction observed in Pilloo, which demanded *"बिल किसके नाम पर बनाना है?"*
for a one-item rice bill and had to be told *"अरे बस बिल बनाओ किसी के नाम पर मत बनाओ."*

**Recommendation:** the field is always visible and always fillable — before, during, or after
billing — and **defaults to "Cash"**. It never blocks finalise. Mobile is optional and free-text.

This captures the same data for udhaar later without putting a question between the shopkeeper and a
finished bill. When udhaar arrives, a real customer identity becomes required only for **credit**
bills — where the shopkeeper actually wants to record who owes them.

*If you want it genuinely blocking, say so and I'll change it. But the thesis says otherwise.*

---

## N2 — Base catalog mechanism 🟢 (confirmed)

- `base_products` — shared, read-only, **versioned**. Seeded from the existing 482 products.
- `shop_products` — per shop. Either references a base product **plus a shop-owned price**, or is
  fully custom.
- **Price always lives in `shop_products`.** Chini is ₹45 in one shop, ₹48 in another.
- At onboarding: import the base catalog, or start empty. Either way, base products can be pulled in
  and edited later.
- Base catalog improvements are **offered**, never auto-applied over a shop's edits.

---

## N1 — Catalog matching: **my rev 1 recommendation was wrong** 🟢

I recommended a 5,000-product client-side threshold. I then benchmarked your actual
`getBestCatalogMatch()`, and the real number is far lower.

**Method:** worst-case queries with no exact match (which is every keystroke of a type-ahead search),
catalog scaled by cloning, budget Android estimated at 4× desktop.

| Catalog | Desktop | Budget Android | Verdict |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 482 | 2.3 ms | ~9 ms | smooth |
| 1,000 | 5.7 ms | ~23 ms | **laggy** |
| 2,000 | 10.0 ms | ~40 ms | laggy |
| 5,000 | 26.4 ms | ~106 ms | **unusable** |
| 10,000 | 56.3 ms | ~225 ms | unusable |
| 20,000 | 126.1 ms | ~504 ms | unusable |

60 fps budget is 16.7 ms per keystroke. Above that, typing visibly stutters.

I also tested whether memoising `buildValidatorCatalog()` helps — it rebuilds the entire index on
every lookup, so it looked like the obvious win. **It isn't.** Memoised timings were within noise.
The cost is the **O(n) linear scan** in the matcher, which scores every catalog entry against every
query variant.

**So the real ceiling of the current implementation is ~1,000 products, not 5,000.**

### Decision

This is an **implementation** limit, not a fundamental one. Client-side search libraries handle tens
of thousands of items smoothly because they use an index instead of a scan.

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Keep the O(n) scan, cap catalog at 1,000 | ❌ Caps the product arbitrarily |
| Move matching server-side (Manus's `pg_trgm`) | ❌ Network call per keystroke; loses the hand-tuned category guards, length-scaled thresholds and phonetic variants in `validator.js`; **and cannot work offline** |
| **Client-side matching backed by a real index** | ✅ **Chosen** |

Implementation:

- Prefix map on the first 2–3 characters → candidate set
- Character n-gram inverted index for fuzzy candidates
- Score only the candidate set (typically tens of entries), never the whole catalog
- Build once on catalog load; update incrementally on edits
- **Every existing guard in `validator.js` is preserved** — they run on candidates, unchanged

**Threshold after this work: 10,000 products client-side.** Above that, server-side search.

*The pilot shop runs 500+ SKUs and is mart-like rather than a corner kirana, so the 10,000 ceiling
has roughly 20× headroom — but it is headroom, not an impossibility. If a shop approaches 5,000,
revisit early rather than at the threshold. See `NI-12`.*

**On what competitors do:** I have no web access, so I won't invent their implementations. What
follows from architecture: desktop-first Indian billing software (Vyapar, Marg, Busy) runs on a
**local database**, so matching is local by definition. Offline-capable mobile POS systems generally
cache the catalog locally, because counter latency is not negotiable and a per-keystroke network
round trip is. **D5 forces the same conclusion independently — server-side matching cannot work
offline.**

**New ticket: `KB-CATALOG-INDEX`.** Now a blocker for type-ahead search, not a nice-to-have.

## O1 — Web Speech API: secondary provider, not primary 🟢

### Strengths
- **Free.** Zero per-call cost — roughly 48% of your per-bill spend at large-v3.
- **Fast.** No audio upload to your server then to Groq. Removes a full round trip.
- **Already in your codebase** as a fallback path.
- **Can work offline** on Android with the Google offline language pack installed — the only
  realistic route to offline voice, short of a WASM Whisper (too heavy for budget phones).

### Weaknesses — one is close to disqualifying
- **No phrase biasing.** You cannot supply a vocabulary. This kills differentiator #2 in the PRD:
  shop-scoped biasing toward one shop's fifty real items, the one lever a generic competitor
  structurally cannot pull. Whisper accepts a `prompt`; Web Speech accepts nothing.
- **No control over the model.** Google can change or throttle it. Not a supported API contract.
- **Browser inconsistency.** Good on Chrome/Android, absent on Firefox, poor on iOS Safari. Inside a
  Capacitor WebView, behaviour depends on the WebView build.
- **Flaky continuous mode on mobile** — your existing code already carries mobile-specific retry and
  queueing logic, which suggests you hit exactly this.
- **Often still needs network.** Google's recogniser is cloud-backed unless the offline pack is present.

### Decision

**Primary: Groq Whisper large-v3.** Phrase biasing is worth more than the cost saving, and the cost
is manageable at pilot scale (~₹300–500/month).

**Secondary: Web Speech API**, behind the same `TranscriptionProvider` interface, used for:
1. Fallback when Groq fails or times out
2. The **offline voice path** (level 3), once levels 1–2 are shipped
3. A cost-reduction option for very high-volume shops later

### Does it block anything?

**No.** Both sit behind one interface, so this is a configuration choice, not an architectural
commitment. It does not limit scalability and it does not block the app. Test it when convenient —
not before Phase 2. The provider interface is the decision that matters; which provider wins is
reversible in a day.

## Rev 3 — 17 Aug 2026

### D7 — Catalog: database is the source of truth, client holds a cache 🟢

**Clarification, not a reversal.** The predecessor's `products.js` was a hardcoded file; that is
exactly what is being replaced.

- **Source of truth: Postgres** (`shop_products`, per shop). Every write is a database write.
- **Client cache: IndexedDB** — a synced read-copy, for instant search and offline operation.
- **Search index: in memory**, built from the cache.

Products are added from the Catalog screen, from bulk Excel import, or **inline during billing** —
all three are the same database write, and all three appear immediately in the catalog list.

**Why not query the server per keystroke:** type-ahead fires on every character; a round trip is
100–300 ms on Indian mobile data and stops working offline. Offline-capable POS software keeps a
local copy — Vyapar's desktop product works this way. The cache is bounded (500 products ≈ 80 KB)
and falls back to server-side search above 10,000.

### D8 — Bulk catalog import 🟢

Excel/CSV upload with a preview-and-confirm step. Table stakes: Vyapar and myBillBook both have it,
and a 500-product shop will not type them in one at a time. New ticket `KB-314`.

### D9 — Phase 0 restructured: build `domain/` first 🟢

**Supersedes:** "fix the grammar in the old codebase, then port it."

The old code is a **reference, not a base.** Its *knowledge* migrates; its *implementation* does not.
Phase 0 now builds `src/domain/` as standalone TypeScript with the eval harness, before any UI,
database or auth. Same work, done once instead of twice.

### D10 — Design direction 🟢

See `13-DESIGN.md`. Utility-instrument layout, Indian palette, Devanagari-first typography.
Explicitly not generic SaaS blue, no gradients, no glassmorphism.

## Rev 4 — 18 Aug 2026

### T1 — Build tool: **Antigravity, single tool through MVP** 🟢

Owner has Google AI Pro (covers Antigravity) and ChatGPT Go (covers Codex).

**Antigravity primary, all phases. Codex backup only** — quota exhaustion mid-ticket, or a bug stuck
over an hour needing different reasoning.

Rationale beyond quota: it is an **IDE**. The owner maintains this codebase alone for years, so
seeing every file change matters more than agent throughput. A cloud agent returning finished diffs
optimises the wrong variable.

### T2 — Lovable dropped 🟢

**Supersedes** rev 1's "Lovable for Phase 3 UI scaffolding." `13-DESIGN.md` and
`05-FRONTEND-SPEC.md` already specify the UI, so the scaffolding value is gone; it generates in its
own idiom requiring reconciliation; and one tool means one code style. Simpler for one person.

### T3 — MCP servers: none at Phase 0 🟢

Each connected MCP injects tool definitions into every request, consuming context. Only three are
ever relevant: **Supabase** (Phase 1, read-only token preferred), **Chrome DevTools** (Phase 3),
**GitHub** (optional). All free. Everything else in Antigravity's catalogue is irrelevant here.

**Migrations stay as committed files applied manually** — the agent never alters the schema directly.

### T4 — Diagrams: **Mermaid** 🟢

Plain text in markdown: versions in git, renders on GitHub, read natively by AI tools. No binary
image files, no external diagram tool, no drift between diagram and doc. All diagrams in this set
are validated against the Mermaid parser.

### T5 — Graphify: parked, not rejected 🟢

Knowledge-graph layer over the codebase to cut agent navigation tokens. **Unknown to this
documentation set** — postdates available knowledge; licence, maintenance and whether it uploads
code are unverified.

On principle: the problem it solves does not exist at Phase 0, because there is no code. The
17-document set already provides a curated context layer, more accurate than an auto-generated
graph. **Reconsider at Phase 3.** Recorded as `NI-13`.

## Closed — 17 Aug 2026

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| **O2** | Sarvam pricing | **Dropped.** Owner will not pursue. Groq Whisper large-v3 is the decision; `TranscriptionProvider` keeps it reversible if accuracy ever demands it. |
| **O3** | Why was the fast-path regex experiment rolled back? | **Void — no such experiment.** The note came from an AI-generated summary, not from the owner. There is no evidence any rollback happened. Build the deterministic parser fresh with no inherited assumption. |
| **O4** | Does Pilloo implement `ka`/`wala`? | **Closed: it does not.** Owner tested "chawal 5 kilo tees wala" and "chawal 5 kilo tees ka" — Pilloo returns the same amount for both. **The pricing grammar is confirmed as a genuine differentiator** and may be claimed. |
